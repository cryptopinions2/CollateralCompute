# CollateralCompute

CollateralCompute is a collateral based method for trustlessly confirming offchain information onto the Ethereum blockchain. Computation, API, etc. results are reported, and then token holders may earn Eth by staking those tokens on whether these reports are correct. The system is designed so that, if the collateral balance is calibrated correctly, incorrect stakes will always result in a loss of Eth greater than the potential gain.
